@siddrrsh @punwaiw @OpenAI @pinecone carta 3.0 incoming
"@SarahHinkfuss Was underwhelmed until like, now"
"@koko_xu_ Sounds like that would make sense for unflattened inputs, but it's just the blind leading the blind"
@koko_xu_ Interesting. Yea it looks like f_C (the scaling factor) should be initialized to ones and h_C (the shifting factor) should be set to zero. Wonder if it's a typo or we're missing some context
"@varunshenoy_ Nice, i'll check it out, thanks"
"@varunshenoy_ Super cool, did you choose from an existing set of voices or can you plug in anyone’s pretty easily?"
"@WouterTeunissen The work that brings you to life is its own form of spiritual nourishment. If you're feeling burnt out, you might be doing the wrong work"
"@TheGeorgePu I think there's a lot of segmentation that can and should happen since every company has entirely different accounting, FP&amp;A, compliance, payroll, expense management, insurance, and risk/fraud needs + solutions.  @mkhandel Has a lot of takes about this  https://t.co/XBChwpTZlb"
"@_Nicsi_ Lmk what you decide and when this thing gets released, big habit guy"
@_Nicsi_ Valid. I think Habitlify sounds AI-generated. Try asking it for one that doesn’t
@_Nicsi_ Maybe I need to understand the reason for ‘house’ but not the biggest fan.  Habity is alright  What about ‘Habitual’ (also from Chat)
"@paulabartabajo_ Been looking for something like this, thanks for the tip"
@paulabartabajo_ Do you think we'll need new MLOps tools for LLMs or do you think the existing ecosystem will adapt just fine?
@_Nicsi_ Have you chosen a name yet?
Stoked to hear some big names talk about big ideas💡
@BirkSepp Valid take
Any strong opinions about Substack vs Beehiiv?
@thesamparr @anumulasachin I’m something of a shithead myself  https://t.co/xPDzIvKkOK
I try my best to meditate 10 minutes a day unless I feel like I don’t have the time- that’s when I sit for 30
"@BeqiriKlodian @alexandr_wang ChatGPT doesn’t need to replace google in order to hurt it. If knowledge workers start going to LLMs for even 10% of all their questions Google will be meaningfully hurt, and I’d bet it could be more"
"@paulabartabajo_ As someone new to the data field, I wayyy underestimated the value of data infra. Clean data doesn’t happen on its own, apparently"
"@mrallendez movement and sunlight as early as possible. Movement could mean a workout, but even just stretching is enough   Also, not helpful for waking up, but drinking water first thing when you wake up is a game changer"
📈📈📈
"@EigenGender Wait, did they evaluate by just asking the doctors if the prompt sounded right to them?"
"@abacaj This is sick, thanks for sharing"
Attention span since getting back on twitter 📉📉
"Startups might have their best edge in like a decade, not just because of the AI boom but because of the timing  The recession is forcing incumbents to play short-term games while also leaking tons of talent into the market. They won't pivot fast enough.  Little fish 🚀🚀"
@vifirsanova I spy opportunity
"@Dmitrij_Rubanov Seasonally and lightly, but yes"
"@JanuszPhD Great thread and great takeaways. I’ve definitely struggled with over-exploration and recently resolved to drill deeply into less projects, thanks for the reminder"
Every first draft is shit. Every beginner looks like one. Everything worth building will be difficult and sloppy-looking until it's not.  Stand your ground and do the thing this year
"@oliver__b1 Nice, congrats man!"
"@xnickroan Careful man, there’s no going back"
"@BirkSepp Nice, now I’m gonna spend hours AB testing every permutation of my writing"
@heffiemetal As you should be
"@koko_xu_ That’s what I’m saying, in the meantime just expanding my surface area for opportunity and getting ready to meet the moment"
"Great map for finding places to solve some problems  Being mindful of my own + others' problems or goals and then asking myself ""What would this look like if it were easy?"" has been one of my favorite heuristics for generating new project ideas"
"@isabelunraveled As someone with similar levels of psychoactivity, i've been appreciating seeing another stream of consciousness on my feed"
@abacaj Super cool. Does this mean the best you can do is identify the page most likely to contain the relevant answer?
"@brendan_goggin @tszzl This is, for the record, a top-tier technical book and totally worth it"
The marginal value of good answers 📉📉  The marginal value of good questions 📈📈
@venturetwins Don’t forget to add “using a Lensa avatar for your profile pic” to the list😁  Congrats on a big year and thanks for the reminder
I’m a dirty sinner
@tunguz What's seed engineering?
"@sparab22 And yet, the biggest games are still ahead"
"While LLMs find their roots in everything, it's a good time for businesses to rethink their data strategy; I think lack of quality data flows will be the biggest bottleneck to AI adoption  I'm also excited to see what new LLM-ops tooling comes out of this wave to help this along"
"If you’re not caught up on what’s going on with AI right now but want to be, this thread has basically everything you need  In particular, 4/ is great for context and 1/ and 2/ are fun looks at what’s coming in the next few months"
@isabelunraveled Well said  We can be so quick to write off good advice as cliché or overdone that we completely miss the point  Thinking that we already “know” these truths is exactly what keeps us from really internalizing them
@tunguz Heinous
"Meditation has become the single most important habit in my life over the past 3 years   The clarity pours over into all other aspects of your life  Whatever your other goals are this year, a consistent meditation practice will help you get there"
@adisidapara Congrats on the big year legend
@sabakarimm Twitch for everything. Why can’t I shadow every knowledge worker on the planet for market research?
"2022 was a fun but weird year for me  Graduating college + moving SF was my only focus for a long time, so it felt weird looking up and realizing I didn’t even have a 1-year plan  Took a couple of months to lock-in on what’s next, but I’m excited to start building in 2023"
@adisidapara @machsci Opinions are my own
@machsci XGBoost or bust
I heard GPT-4 is gonna align GPT-3 for us
@tunguz I was once on a date at a loud restaurant and said “the acoustics in this room are suboptimal”
@marktenenholtz My new kicks 👟
@AliAbdaal Started going to the gym and showering in the middle of my workday instead of at the end.   Game changer for the post-lunch drowsies 😴
@EcZachly @SeattleDataGuy Do you have opinions on the tools and tech that will define data eng in the next 3-5 years?

@kwncsl_ ☝️😲....  .....😞👌
@kwncsl_ Can’t claim cankles if ya ain’t got ankles
@richcocacola @kwncsl_ Bless your soul my dude
Every day I wake up and say good morning to the kids in my dorm and every day they say “it’s like 1pm”. That’s disrespectful.
@jdvaldezz Is this the slow-carb talking
Sleeping in is a 3 unit time commitment
My favorite hobby in college is dropping units and calling it “self care”
@jdvaldezz This right here is standard my boy
